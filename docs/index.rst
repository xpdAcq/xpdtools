Welcome to xpdtools's documentation!
====================================

This project holds data processing tools and command line interfaces for
processing data from images to integrated intensities and atomic pair
distribution functions. The tools are put together via a ``streamz`` pipeline.

Installation
============

``xpdtools`` is installable via the ``conda`` package manager.
If you don't have Anaconda (or miniconda) installed please follow the instructions
from `Data Carpentry <https://datacarpentry.org/2016-05-29-PyCon/install.html>`_.

With Anaconda or miniconda please enter into a terminal (on Windows Anaconda
ships with a dedicated command prompt) and type

``conda install xpdtools -c conda-forge``

and follow the prompts. This will install the xpdtools software and all of its dependencies.

Please check that the software is installed by typing in the terminal (in any directory), ``image_to_iq -- --help``.
This should display a help description of how to use the ``image_to_iq``
command line interface.

Quickstart
==========
To use the command line interface (CLI) type
``image_to_iq <poni_file> <image_file>``.
For more information about CLI options ``image_to_iq -- --help`` will provide
the help information.

Note that you will need pyFAI calibration files (``.poni`` files) which are
generated via ``pyFAI-calib``.
For most usages the pyFAI calibration is
``pyFAI-calib -D Perkin -w <wavelength> -c Ni <calibration_img>``.
Please see `pyFAI's documentation <https://pyfai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/pyFAI-calib2.html>`_ and see our `docs for how to use pyFAI <https://xpdacq.github.io/xpdAcq/features.html?highlight=calibration#automated-calibration-capture>`_.
